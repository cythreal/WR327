Primary Research Question
-------------------------
What does the term Lean mean in the context of product development (PD)? To what limit can you use Lean to improve PD? Who is using Lean in PD currently and how are they using it?

Scope
-----
All things related to Lean in when applying the method to product development.
1999-2005
"there is clear evidence in the literature that
the benefits of Lean cannot be realized simply by
adopting a few tools and techniques."

"the purpose of this paper is to provide an up-to-date review of
Lean (in its widest interpretation) and its application
to the processes of PD within manufacturing
enterprises."

the popular emphasis is on ‘value’ and how it can be maximized.
This shift from waste elimination to value enhance-
ment is exemplified by Browning [20] who argued
that during the PD process maximizing value can
be achieved by doing more, not less.

Secondary Research Questions

Findings
--------
"The consequence of this drift is that there is a
danger for both researchers and practitioners, of
misinterpreting the ideas that are being put forward
during any discussion about Lean." (5)

"It is clear that Lean can be applied
(although the extent is yet to be con-
firmed) to product design, engineering
and development in the aerospace and
other sectors." (6)

"Value in the PD process needs to be
defined precisely as it is not necessarily
the same as value in production
operations."

"The Toyota approach of applying set-
based concurrent engineering with par-
allel evaluation of multiple subsystem
alternatives and minimal design con-
straints provides an effective base for
Lean design." (6)

or

"Adoption of a set-based approach
is favoured" (7)

"Adoption of Lean requires strong
leadership of a CE with responsibility
for the total project"

"A truly successful application of Lean
requires organization-wide changes in
systems practices and behaviour."

Issues
------
"The standardization of knowledge/
information management processes that
support the adoption of Lean in PD is
yet to be defined."(7)

"The key areas of value creation in the design
process remain unresolved."(8)
