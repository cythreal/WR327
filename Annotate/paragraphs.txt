Primary Research Question
-------------------------
What applications are using the Tor network and what effect to those applications have on network
performance?
Scope
-----
The data was collected during two seperate experiments December 2009 and January 2010. The two
data sets displayed similar trends. The data collected was in aggragated format meaning no user IP
addresses were stored and the researchers were very careful not to break privacy laws or infringe on
the privacy of the users. OpenDPI, an open source deep packet inspection too, was used to classify
network traffic.

Secondary Research Questions
----------------------------
Which protocols use the most bandwidth and what type of content does a user interact with while
using Tor?


Findings
--------
Two main ares:
## BitTorrent
BitTorrent traffic was the top contributer to bandwidth usage
the bandwidth used by BitTorrent is disproportionate to other protocols
the use of non-encrypted protocols is minimal.
Many users use Tor as an easy way to set up a SOCKS proxy, this does not comply with the Tor protocol
One quarter recorded traffic was unidentifiable by DPI techniques. The researchers
were able to confirm with certainty that this traffic was encrypted BitTorrent and reinforced the
finding that majority of traffic consists of the BitTorrent protocol.
Using torrent infohashes, copyrighted movies, games, and T.V. shows were shown to be the most
commonly torrented content type.

## HTTP
HTTP is responsible for most of the connections being made over the Tor network
Popular content included (in order from most popular to least popular): Search Engine/Portals,
Pornography, Computer/Internet, Social Networking, and Blogs/Web Communication.

## Geopolitical data
Seventy precent of clients that connected to the controlled entry nodes originated from only 10
contries. The most common place of origin were the US and Germany and the proposed cause was that the high
availability of internet and an increase in copyright law in those two countries caused the high.

Recommendations
---------------
The authors hope that the data that they collected would help later research identify and fix
problems in Tor.

in the Tor Overlay.” Peer-to-Peer Computing (P2P), 2010 IEEE Tenth International Conference on. 2010, 1 –4.

Primary Research Question
-------------------------
What causes delay in Tor?

Scope
-----
Observe routers in isolation and as sets of routers.
Experiment went from August 2009 to March 2010.
Used 4 nodes, three of which they controlled, to isolate an Onion Router.
Used a chain of 4 nodes made of an onion proxy, entry router, exit router, and webserver controlled
op, exit router, and webserver
They broke the delay into two types: router delay, which is caused by queing and processing data
cells, and latency, which is caused by delays in the connection median.


Secondary Research Questions
----------------------------
Does router delay or latency cause more delay in Tor.

Findings
--------
Experimental data was easy to replicate and trends in collected data were consistent over multiple trials of.

It is normal for total delay caused by a router to not have any correlation with it's advertized bandwith.

When there is a delay of greater than one second it is probably caused by router delay.
Different routers can cause varying delays, but the majority of routers introduced less than 100ms
of delay. 

Experimental results showed fluctuation in router delay. The authors reason that either the Tor
router selection algorithm is causing the fluctuations or the machine that is running the router is
using bandwidth elsewhere to server other applications.

By isolating a router in a lab environment, it was discovered that most router delay was caused by a
bottle neck in the output socket write buffer. This is a common situation when the router is
handling large amounts of traffic.

Recommendations
---------------
The paper concludes by recommending modification to Tor's path selection algorithm and cell scheduling algorithm.
