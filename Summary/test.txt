The review found that information about how an organization's management should implement Lean in
PD is not readily accessible. They also found when Lean is used in PD, value creation is not well defined.
Organizations may need to completely re-organize to successfully implement Lean in their development
process.
When Lean is used in PD, the leadership provided by the chief engineer (CE) is critical.
To help guide application, the review suggest that the methods used by Toyota (credited for
developing modern Lean techniques) could be applied to PD. The review recommends forcing individual
functions of the design process to ensure a part of the final product.
The Lean used in manufacturing is well defined. The Lean that could be used in product
design is not yet well defined. This vagueness can be attributed to Lean's origin, manufacturing, and
only recent application to PD.
Lean is a viable option for PD, specifically in the aerospace industry, but to what
extent is still unknown.
The term "Lean" was developed by the manufacturing industry. Because the process of design
is different than manufacturing, the definition of "Lean" is starting to change. This is causing
misunderstandings between researchers and practitioners when discussing Lean.
The authors had six main findings:
In the Literature review \emph{State-of-the-art in lean design engineering: a literature review on
white collar lean} by T Baines*, H Lightfoot, G M Williams, and R Greenough, sought to answer the
questions: What is the meaning of the term "Lean" in the context of product development (PD) and how
can Lean be used to improve PD? How is Lean currently being used in PD? The review was targeted
towards PD in the aerospace industry. The review did not find very many articles about Lean's
application in PD. But, the existing evidence does show that applying Lean to product design can be
economically beneficial.
