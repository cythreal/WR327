Writing a summary is a process:
===============================
Step 1.
    Read the article... more than once.
    First time:
        Read for a general sense of what is there and what it is about
            Don't worry about taking notes
            Don't re-read stuff
Step 2.
    Read it again. and again and again.
    Write notes, highlight, highlight
    Looking for :
        General Topic - What is it about?
        Main idea - Authors arguments, what are they trying to communicate
            * specific examples of these ideas

Step 3.
    Write a one sentence summary of each paragraph in order.

Step 4.
    Write a once sentence summary of the whole document. (a.k.a A Thesis Statement)

Step 5.
    Write 1st draft.
    Format
    ++++++
    Thesis
    ...
    (Sentances written in Step 3)
    ...

    Add connective tissue.

Step 6.
    Check summary against the original.

Step 7.
    Revise and proof read. (Two very different things)
    Revision
    --------
    Re-thinking, seeing things again, maybe starting again.
    Proof Read
    ----------
