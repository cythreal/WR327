My camping headlamp is a pocket sized light source designed for wearing around one's head during
situations when visibility could be aided by a supplementary light source. The headlamp is made up
of two parts: the lamp, and the strap.  The lamp is roughly 1/4 pounds when loaded with it's 3 AAA
battery power source. The lamp has 6 main LED bulbs, 4 of the bulbs are white and the
remaining 2 are red. The variable length strap is a maximum 2 feet long, and at it's minimum 1/2 foot long.
