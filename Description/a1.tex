The FredMeyer headlamp is a pocket sized light source made for wearing around a user's head during
situations when visibility could be aided by a supplementary light source.

The headlamp is made up of two physical parts: a black lamp containing 6 LEDs (Light Emitting
Diodes), and a black elastic variable-length strap. The lamp has three settings allowing for light
of different color to be emitted from the LEDs. This paper describes the lamp, strap, and power
settings.

\section{The Lamp}
The lamp preforms the primary function of the headlamp. It is 1/4 pounds when loaded with
it's 3 AAA-battery power source. The lamp itself is split into two modules: the bulb housing and the
battery case. The two modules are joined by a hinge which allows the LEDs to be aimed variably (see
Figure 2).

\begin{table}[h!]
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ | c | c | c | p{5cm} |}
    \hline
    Height & Width & Depth \\ \hline
    3.5 cm & 5 cm & 3.5 cm  \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\caption{Lamp Dimensions}
\end{table}

\subsection{Bulb Housing}
The bulb housing module holds the LEDs, LED casing, and power switch.

\subsubsection{LEDs}
The lamp has 6 main LEDs, 4 of the LEDs are white and the other 2 are red. Of the 4 white LED's
2 of them have a radius of 0.5 cm and are located symmetrically opposite of each other located 1 cm
away from the front center line of the lamp.  The remaining 4 LEDs have a radius of 0.25 cm and are
aligned symmetrically opposite to each other and are lined up starting 2 cm away from the front
center line of the lamp. With regard to the 4 0.5 cm LEDs, the two furthest from the center line are
white, the inner pair are red (see Figure 1).

\subsubsection{LED Casing}
To protect the LEDs, a clear form fitting case covers the front of the lamp.  The case also acts to
focus and intensify the light from the LEDs. The case consists of hard plastic and is roughly
3 mm thick.

\subsubsection{Power button}
Turning on the lamp and cycling through the lamp's power settings is done with the plastic yellow
power button located on the top of the lamp (see Figure 3). The button is pressure sensitive.

\subsection{Battery Case}
The majority of the headlamp is used to house the power supply. The supply case is rectangular with
rounded edges (see Figure 2). It is 5 cm across, 3.5 cm wide, and 1.5 cm deep. When in use, the back of
the case is placed onto the users' forehead. To make this more comfortable there is a soft black
pad on the back 5 cm by 3.5 cm panel.

\section{The Strap}
The strap holds the headlamp to the users' head. The elastic variable-length strap is at maximum 2 ft
long, and at minimum 1/2 ft long (see Figure 3).
\begin{table}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ | c | c | c | p{5cm} |}
    \hline
    Height & Thickness & Length \\ \hline
    1.5 cm & 2.5 mm & 2ft  \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\caption[Strap Dimensions]{Strap Dimensions when the strap is fully extended.}

\end{table}

\section{LED settings}
Pressing the the power button will cycle the LEDs through three differnt modes: Normal-White,
Bright-White, and Flashing-Red (see table 3). These settings are achieved by powering some LEDs while not
powering others.

\begin{table}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ | c | c | c | p{5cm} |}
    \hline
    State & State Offset & \# of Powered LEDs & Description \\ \hline
    Normal White & 1 & 2 &  Baic setting. Two main LEDs are powered. Most appropriate for use over
    long durations of time.\\ \hline
    Bright White & 2 & 4 &  Brightest setting. Two main LEDs and two white auxilary LEDs powered.
    Most appropriate setting when a very bright light is needed.\\ \hline
    Flashing Red & 3 & 4 &  Highest contrast setting. Two red auxilary LEDs flash.\\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\caption[Lamp Power States] {Headlamp states. State Offset refers to the offset (number of power
states) from the 'off' state.}
\end{table}

\subsection{Normal-White}
From the off state, pressing the button once will place the headlamp into the Normal-White state.  This
setting drives power to the two main 0.5 cm-radius-LEDs.

\subsection{Bright-White}
From the off state, pressing the button twice will place the headlamp into the Bright-White state.
This setting drives power to both the two main 0.5 cm-radius-leds and the two outer white 0.25
cm-radius-LEDs. The headlamp emits the most light while in this state.

\subsection{Flashing-Red}
From the off state, pressing the button three times will place the headlamp into the Flashing-Red state.
This setting drives power to the two inner 0.5 cm-radius-leds. While in this state the
LEDs will flash on and off at a frequency of 3 times per second. Each flash has a duration of
0.25 seconds.
